## Purpose

These protections exist to enforce three repository policies:

- No direct pushes to `main`
- No direct pushes to `develop`
- No merge into either protected branch unless the required CI checks pass

Local hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` complement this policy, but GitHub branch protection is the
authoritative enforcement layer in the current repository configuration.

## Recommended Required Checks

Choose the required-check baseline that matches how the repository accepts pull requests (PRs).

Because `.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses a matrix for operating systems and Python versions, GitHub
exposes expanded matrix job names in the branch protection UI rather than the template name shown in
the YAML. Select those expanded names when configuring required checks.

The current workflow model is staged rather than post-merge:

- `.github/workflows/pr.yml` provides the lighter required pull-request baseline and the
  `merge_group` coverage used by merge queue.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` provides heavier pre-merge validation for pull requests targeting the
  protected `main` and `develop` branches and also runs on `merge_group` for merge queue.

That means the GitHub branch-protection policy should distinguish between the minimum merge gate
that always runs and the heavier pre-merge checks that you may choose to require for protected
branches.

### Pull Request Baseline

Use this baseline for protected-branch merge gates. It covers the checks that run for both
`pull_request` and `merge_group` in `pr.yml`.

#### Policy Categories

- GitFlow target-branch enforcement for pull requests
- Root action metadata presence
- YAML syntax validation for GitHub configuration
- Fast local-action smoke test on Ubuntu
- Optional input smoke test on Ubuntu

These categories define the minimum merge gate for protected branches.

#### Current Resolved Check Names

In the current PR-gates workflow, the baseline above resolves to:

- `Guard PR target branch`
- `Validate repository metadata`
- `Smoke test action`
- `Smoke test optional inputs`

Additional CI jobs are still useful, and they can be made required for normal pull-request merges
into `main` and `develop` if you want the heavier pre-merge workflow to block those merges.

#### Current Required Check Names To Select In GitHub

When configuring `main` or `develop` branch protection rules in the GitHub UI, select these PR-gate
job names as the minimum required checks:

- `Guard PR target branch`
- `Validate repository metadata`
- `Smoke test action`
- `Smoke test optional inputs`

### Advisory Categories

- Cross-platform action smoke tests
- Additional supported Python-version checks
- Optional input checks on supported runner operating systems

### Current Advisory Examples

In the current CI workflow, those advisory categories resolve to expanded matrix job names like:

- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Optional inputs on ubuntu-latest`
- `Optional inputs on macos-latest`
- `Optional inputs on windows-latest`

If you want the heavier pre-merge workflow to block normal pull-request merges into `main` and
`develop`, add the full emitted CI matrix:

- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.11`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.12`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.13`
- `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.14`
- `Optional inputs on ubuntu-latest`
- `Optional inputs on macos-latest`
- `Optional inputs on windows-latest`

That keeps the staged PR-gates and heavier-CI layout intact without collapsing everything back into
a single workflow. Because `ci.yml` also runs on `merge_group`, those heavier checks can be made
required for queued merges too when merge queue is enabled.

## Shared Protection Baseline

Apply this baseline to both protected branches:

- Require a PR before merging
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Add the required checks listed above
- If merge queue is enabled, keep the `merge_group` trigger in PR Gates so the same checks run for
  queued merges

In GitHub, these controls are typically split across PR rules, status check rules, and branch
protections.

### Branch Protections

- Block force pushes
- Block branch deletion
- Keep bypass actors empty if possible
- If bypass cannot be empty, restrict it to a very small maintainer/admin set

## Branch Protection Checklist For `main`

Target:

- Branch name pattern: `main`
- Enforcement: `Active`

Branch-specific additions:

- Require `2` approvals
- Require Code Owners review

Recommended baseline:

- Require the full pull-request baseline from `pr.yml`.
- Consider also requiring the heavier `ci.yml` jobs on `main` if you want release-oriented pull
  requests into `main` to satisfy the extended action compatibility matrix before merge.

Optional hardening:

- Require signed commits
- Require merge queue

## Branch Protection Checklist For `develop`

Target:

- Branch name pattern: `develop`
- Enforcement: `Active`

Branch-specific additions:

- Require `1` approval

Recommended baseline:

- Require the full pull-request baseline from `pr.yml`.
- Consider also requiring the heavier `ci.yml` jobs on `develop` if you want the extended docs or
  smoke test matrix to block feature integration into `develop`.

Optional hardening:

- Require Code Owners review for sensitive paths
- Require merge queue if `develop` receives enough concurrent PR traffic to make merge-order
  conflicts common

## How To Disallow Direct Pushes

The reliable way to disallow direct pushes is to protect the branch and require PRs. CI alone cannot
block a normal direct push after the fact, because GitHub Actions runs only after the push exists.

This repository currently applies these controls with classic branch protection on `main` and
`develop`, not repository rulesets.

In GitHub:

1. Open repository `Settings`.
2. Open `Branches`.
3. Open the branch protection rule for `main` or `develop`.
4. Enable `Require a PR before merging`.
5. For `main`, enable `Require review from Code Owners`.
6. Enable `Require status checks to pass before merging`.
7. Enable `Require branches to be up to date before merging`.
8. Enable `Block force pushes`.
9. Enable `Block deletions`.
10. Remove bypass actors unless there is a strict operational need.

## How To Update Required Checks In GitHub

After the workflow split and the later `ci.yml` trigger redesign, update the protected-branch
protections in GitHub so the minimum required checks come from `pr.yml`, then add the heavier
`ci.yml` checks if you want that extended pre-merge validation to be blocking on `main` and
`develop`.

In GitHub:

1. Open repository `Settings`.
2. Open `Branches`.
3. Open the branch protection rule for `main`.
4. Under `Require status checks to pass`, remove any stale checks emitted by the heavier CI or old
   workflow filenames.
5. Add these minimum required checks from `pr.yml`:
  - `Guard PR target branch`
  - `Validate repository metadata`
  - `Smoke test action`
  - `Smoke test optional inputs`
6. If you want the heavier pre-merge `ci.yml` workflow to block ordinary PR merges into `main` and
   `develop`, also add these checks:
  - `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.11`
  - `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.12`
  - `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.13`
  - `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.14`
  - `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.11`
  - `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.12`
  - `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.13`
  - `Action on macos-latest / Python 3.14`
  - `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.11`
  - `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.12`
  - `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.13`
  - `Action on windows-latest / Python 3.14`
  - `Optional inputs on ubuntu-latest`
  - `Optional inputs on macos-latest`
  - `Optional inputs on windows-latest`
7. Save the `main` branch protection rule.
8. Repeat the same status-check set for the `develop` branch protection rule unless you
   intentionally want a different protected-branch policy.

If merge queue is enabled, keep the heavier `ci.yml` checks aligned with the same required-check
policy you use for normal pull requests into `main` and `develop`.

With that configuration in place:

- Contributors push to feature, bugfix, hotfix, release, chore, ci, or docs branches
- Feature branches cannot merge into `main` while `Guard PR target branch` is required
- Pull requests into `main` and `develop` carry both the PR-gates results and the heavier CI results
- `main` and `develop` cannot be updated directly by ordinary pushes
- Merges remain blocked until the required checks pass

## Maintenance Notes

- GitHub required checks are tied to the exact job names emitted by the PR-gates workflow after
  matrix expansion. In this repository, that means branch protection should reference concrete names
  such as `Guard PR target branch` and `Action on ubuntu-latest / Python 3.14`, not the template
  strings shown in the YAML.
- Treat version-specific and OS-specific names in this document as current examples, not permanent
  policy. When the support matrix changes, refresh the exact examples here and in the GitHub branch
  protection UI to match the emitted checks.
- The heavier CI jobs now run on both `pull_request` and `merge_group` for `main` and `develop`, so
  protected-branch required checks can stay aligned between normal PR merges and merge queue.
- The PR-target guard intentionally enforces these GitFlow merge paths: `feature/* -> develop`,
  `release/* -> main`, and `hotfix/* -> main`.
- The local `no-commit-to-branch` pre-commit hook should protect `main` and `develop`, but it is
  only a contributor convenience. GitHub branch protection remains authoritative.
