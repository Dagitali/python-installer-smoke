## Highlights

- Summarize the most important user-visible changes in 2-5 bullets.
- Focus on what users can now do, what became more reliable, or what changed in support
  expectations.

## Breaking Changes

- List any breaking change explicitly.
- If none, write `None.`

## Deprecations

- List any newly deprecated flags, APIs, config shapes, or handlers.
- If none, write `None.`

## Fixes

- Summarize the most important bug fixes.
- Prefer behavior-focused language over internal implementation detail.

## Documentation and Maintenance

- Call out important docs improvements, CI/release automation changes, or contributor-facing
  maintenance work.
- For release-smoke changes, state which runner operating systems and Python versions were validated
  for the tagged action.

## Upgrade Notes

- Mention any required user action, dependency changes, migration steps, or compatibility
  expectations.
- If nothing special is required, write `No special upgrade steps.`

## Support Boundary

- Re-state any release-specific support or stability caveats when needed.
- Keep the message aligned with the [README][README] and [SUPPORT][SUPPORT] policy.

## Notes for Maintainers

- Cross-check the generated GitHub release notes against this template.
- Make sure breaking changes and deprecations are never left only in the auto- generated PR summary.
- Keep terminology consistent with the documented stable surface in the [README][README].
