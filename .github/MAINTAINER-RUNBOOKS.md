# Maintainer Runbooks

Maintainer-facing runbooks for working with protected branches, GitHub pull requests (PRs), and
tag-triggered releases.

This file is intentionally kept under `.github/` because it supports repository operations rather
than end-user action usage.

## Operating Model

python-installer-smoke uses GitFlow-style branch names together with GitHub-protected `develop` and
`main` branches.

The important consequence is:

- Working happens on `feature/*`, `release/*`, and `hotfix/*`
- Authoritative integration happens through PRs
- PR targets should follow the GitFlow branch map enforced by the PR-gates workflow
- `develop` and `main` should be treated as GitHub-managed integration branches, not as branches
  that are finished locally and pushed afterward

Local `git flow feature finish` and `git flow release finish` may still be useful for personal
experimentation in a local clone, but they should not be treated as the final source of truth for
protected branches.

Prefer `git flow ... start` for creating working branches. Do not treat `git flow ... finish` as a
cleanup step for this protected-branch workflow, because it performs local merges into integration
branches. After the authoritative GitHub PR merge, prefer manual local branch cleanup instead.

This file stays at the policy and high-level workflow layer. Sensitive operator details should live
outside the public repository.

## Feature Branch Runbook

Use for normal development work.

1. Create a local feature branch from your local `develop` branch. Example: `git flow feature start
   my-change`
2. Commit your changes locally on that feature branch.
3. Push the feature branch to the remote GitHub repository. Example: `git push -u origin
   feature/my-change`
4. Open a PR from the remote `feature/*` branch into the remote `develop` branch. The PR-gates
   workflow rejects `feature/*` pull requests that target `main`.
5. Let `.github/workflows/pr.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` run on GitHub. For feature work,
   the heavier `ci.yml` checks run because the PR targets `develop`.
6. Merge the PR in GitHub once both workflows report the required checks for your target branch.
7. Delete the remote feature branch on GitHub after merge if it is no longer needed, and clean up
   your local branch when convenient. Preferred local cleanup: delete the local feature branch
   manually after updating your local branch state.

## Release Branch Runbook

Use for release stabilization and promotion.

1. Create a local `release/<version>` branch from your local `develop` branch. Example: `git flow
   release start 1.13.6`
2. Commit release-targeted stabilization changes locally on that release branch.
3. Push the release branch to the remote GitHub repository. Example: `git push -u origin
   release/1.13.6`
4. Open a PR from the remote `release/*` branch into the remote `main` branch. The PR-gates workflow
   reserves `main` for `release/*` and `hotfix/*` pull requests.
5. Merge the PR on GitHub after both `.github/workflows/pr.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   report the required checks for `main`.
6. Fetch the newly merged remote `main` commit into your local repository. Example: `git fetch
   origin main`
7. Create or move the annotated release tag locally so it points at that fetched `main` commit.
   Example: `git tag -a v1.13.6 origin/main -m "Release v1.13.6"`
8. Push the annotated release tag to GitHub. Example: `git push origin v1.13.6`
9. Confirm `.github/workflows/cd.yml` runs on GitHub from that pushed tag.
10. Sync the resulting remote `main` state back into `develop` explicitly. See [Sync Main Back To
    Develop](#sync-main-back-to-develop).

## Hotfix Branch Runbook

Use for production fixes that must land on `main` first.

1. Create a local `hotfix/<version>` branch from your local `main` branch. Example: `git flow hotfix
   start 1.13.7`
2. Apply and validate the fix locally on that hotfix branch.
3. Push the hotfix branch to the remote GitHub repository. Example: `git push -u origin
   hotfix/1.13.7`
4. Open a PR from the remote `hotfix/*` branch into the remote `main` branch. The PR-gates workflow
   reserves `main` for `release/*` and `hotfix/*` pull requests.
5. Merge the PR in GitHub after both `.github/workflows/pr.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   report the required checks for `main`.
6. Fetch the newly merged remote `main` commit into your local repository. Example: `git fetch
   origin main`
7. Create or move the annotated hotfix tag locally so it points at that fetched `main` commit.
   Example: `git tag -a v1.13.7 origin/main -m "Release v1.13.7"`
8. Push the annotated hotfix tag to GitHub. Example: `git push origin v1.13.7`
9. Sync the resulting remote `main` state back into `develop` explicitly. See [Sync Main Back To
   Develop](#sync-main-back-to-develop).

## Sync Main Back To Develop

After a release or hotfix lands on `main`, update `develop` deliberately rather than assuming both
protected branches are already aligned.

Preferred sequence:

1. Fetch or pull the latest remote `main` and `develop` state into your local repository. Example:
   `git fetch origin main develop`
2. Create a temporary local sync branch from your updated local `develop` branch if you want a
   reviewable sync PR. Example: `git switch develop && git pull --ff-only origin develop && git
   switch -c sync/main-into-develop`
3. Merge your updated local tracking copy of `main` into that local sync branch or directly into
   your local `develop` branch. Example: `git merge --no-ff origin/main`
4. If branch protection or review policy requires GitHub review, push the sync branch to GitHub and
   open a PR into the remote `develop` branch. Example: `git push -u origin sync/main-into-develop`
5. Merge on GitHub once the required checks for `develop` pass, including `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   if that heavier pre-merge workflow is part of your `develop` branch-protection rule, or push the
   updated local `develop` branch only if your branch protection model intentionally allows that
   path.

## Tagging And CD

`cd.yml` is tag-driven.

- A successful `ci.yml` run does not trigger `cd.yml`.
- `cd.yml` runs only when a local `v*.*.*` tag is pushed to GitHub.
- The local tag should point at the authoritative merged `main` commit that already exists on the
  remote repository for the release.
- Use annotated tags for releases before pushing them to GitHub.

## Solo-Maintainer Notes

It is normal for a solo maintainer to use PRs for both feature and release branches once protected
branches are enabled.

The PR still provides value even without another human reviewer:

- Required checks run on the proposed branch change before the protected branch moves
- GitHub becomes the authoritative merge surface for protected branches
- Release and branch history stay aligned with the repository protection model

For a solo-maintainer repository, it is reasonable to keep the policy lightweight:

- One required approval on `develop`, or an intentionally documented exception path
- Stricter review on `main` only if that is useful for release discipline
- Narrow admin bypass only when necessary and documented in `.github/BRANCH-PROTECTION.md`

## Keep Private Elsewhere

If python-installer-smoke needs deeper operator documentation, keep it outside this public
repository.

Examples that should live in a truly private location include:

- Exact release execution checklists and recovery commands
- Secrets, credential rotation, or trusted-publisher maintenance steps
- Emergency branch-protection bypass procedures
- Security-incident response details
- Account recovery or succession notes
