## Support Policy

python-installer-smoke is maintained as an open source project with best-effort community support.

The support baseline is:

- Supported collaboration channels: GitHub Discussions for usage and docs questions, GitHub Issues
  for confirmed bugs and concrete feature requests, and the security reporting path for private
  vulnerabilities.

Anything marked as placeholder, stubbed, defunct, or experimental in the repository docs should be
treated as out of the stable support promise until explicitly promoted.

## Supported Versions

The maintenance target is:

- The latest released minor line.
- The immediately previous minor line for critical regressions and security fixes, when practical.

Older versions may still work, but they should not be assumed to receive routine fixes.

## Maintenance Expectations

python-installer-smoke uses minor releases as the normal delivery vehicle for new features,
non-urgent enhancements, broader dependency updates, and deprecations.

Patch releases are intended for targeted, low-risk maintenance such as:

- Confirmed regressions in documented behavior
- Security fixes
- Packaging, build, or install breakages
- Docs or metadata corrections that are needed to keep the released artifact usable

Backports are not guaranteed for every fix. When practical, critical regressions and security fixes
may be applied to the latest released minor line and the immediately previous minor line. Routine
feature work, behavior changes, and larger internal refactors are expected to land only on the
latest active minor line.

## Where to Get Help

- **Questions & Usage**: Please use [GitHub Discussions][discussions] for general questions, usage
  help, and best practices.
- **Docs Feedback & Examples**: Please use [GitHub Discussions][discussions] for documentation gaps,
  unclear sections, and example-sharing.
- **Bugs & Feature Requests**: Open an issue in the [GitHub Issues][issues] tracker.
- **Security Issues**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.
- **Documentation**: See the [README](README.md) and [docs/](docs/) directory for guides and
  references.

In general:

- Use Discussions for questions, docs feedback, examples, and support conversations.
- Use Issues for confirmed bugs and concrete feature requests.
- See [docs/community-discussions.md](docs/community-discussions.md) for the recommended category
  structure and starter discussions.

## Response Targets

These are response targets, not guaranteed service-level agreements.

- Security reports: initial acknowledgement within 3 business days when received through the
  documented security channel.
- Confirmed bug reports and feature requests: initial triage target within 10 business days.
- Usage questions and docs discussions: response target within 10 business days when maintainer time
  allows.

Community contributions and peer support remain welcome even when maintainer response is delayed.

## Deprecation Policy

python-installer-smoke aims to avoid abrupt breaking changes to documented public surfaces.

- Deprecations should be called out in the changelog and nearby user-facing docs.
- Patch releases should not normally remove or materially redefine documented public behavior.
- Removal may happen sooner only for security, correctness, or ecosystem-compatibility reasons.

Internal, defunct, placeholder, or undocumented modules are excluded from this deprecation policy.
